# Key
Key is an early-stage Programming Language, written in Typescript. Inspired by C# and Typescript.  
*Note: This programming language is subjective for a language transfer, either to C++ or Rust.*

# Plan
The primary goal of Key is to create a general purpose, OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language, capable of graphics rendering and creating GUI applications.
A rough idea of how this language will look in the future is shown [here](https://github.com/Winter-r/Key/blob/main/Examples/goal.ky).
